			There was an alleyway, <br>
			behind the pagoda, near the church,<br>
			where grandpa would walk with me to bible class. <br><br>
			
			Tall and crooked buildings form the way,<br>
			with few rays of light to guide us through.<br>
			But I felt safe, holding my grandpa's hands. <br><br>

			<i>"You stay in class, alright, and I’ll see you in mass later."</i><br>
			He said as we reached the church’s gate.<br>
			And have fun!<br><br>

			That’s all I can remember. <br>
			Those afternoons where we would walk<br>
			hand in hand when I was 10.<br><br>

			Gramps passed 6 years later.<br>
			With him, the alley faded away.<br>
			I’ve tried to find it, but I never could.<br><br>
				
			Oh, what I would give to be there again.<br>
			That dark passage on a July’s afternoon,<br>
			hidden away, from the heat, the sun, and everything.<br><br>

			Even from my memory. <br>

		<p id="secrets">
			Mom is depressed.<br>
			She stays home all day, <br>
			playing games on the iPad,<br>
			cooking, cleaning, but always<br>
			spends her time on bed <br>
			when nothing is going on.<br><br>

			Mom always argues with dad.<br>
			They have an unhappy marriage,<br>
			always yelling, smashing things,<br>
			and calling each other’s names,<br>
			when they argue. They are happiest,<br>
			when they don’t interact <br> 
			with one another.<br><br>

			Mom had an affair. <br>
			I called it “the incident,” because<br>
			I was too small to understand what it is,<br>
			to be unfaithful, or unhappy,<br>
			or wanting a way out. <br>
			And nobody told me and my sister anything.<br><br>

			Dad is always angry.<br>
			I don’t blame him. It <br>
			must be frustrating, disappointing,<br>
			to find out your wife turned to another man,<br>
			for her needs. But dad <br>
			didn’t get a divorce.<br> 
			And I don’t understand why.<br><br>

			My sister is too small.<br>
			I’m not old enough,<br>
			to be told what was going on, but<br>
			I understand. I always<br>
			listened. I just want it to be the same<br>
			Again.<br><br>

			I call it “the incident.”<br>
			We don’t talk about “the incident,”<br>
			but we yell at each other about it,<br>
			with every chance we have.<br>

		<p class="sex">	
			Have you ever felt weak in the knees?<br>
			Have you ever felt so nervous you couldn’t speak?<br><br>

			Sex is cool, but have you ever been in love?<br><br>

			Have you ever stayed up till 3 in the morning just because you can’t get that one person off your mind?<br>
			Have you ever wanted to see someone so badly that you fake going to their workplace just so you can “run into” them?<br><br>

			Sex is good, but have you ever been in love?<br><br>

			Have you ever wanted to talk to someone every single minute of everyday?<br>
			You might be afraid of running out of things to say, but I promise you, there aren’t enough.<br><br> 

			Sex is fine, but have you ever been in love?<br><br>

			Have you ever wanted to share your world with someone else?<br>
			Doing your own things, but close to that one person all day long.<br><br>

			Sex is all right, but have you ever been in love?<br><br> 

			Have you ever wanted to be true with someone else? <br>
			To care, to grow, to protect, to be vulnerable, all day everyday.<br><br>

			Sex is nice, but have you ever been in love?<br><br>

			Love feels like getting punched in the guts<br>
			But still, you wanted more.<br><br>

			Love feels like waves of madness, chaos, and insanity ready to swallow you whole,<br>
			Yet you can’t help but asking for them.<br><br>
				
			Love makes you listen to all the sad songs in the world<br>
			You don’t fully understand all of them, but the lyrics still get to you somehow.<br>

			Sex is okay, but have you ever been in love?<br><br>

			Love is cold<br>
			And love is warm<br><br>

			Love is hard<br>
			And love is tender<br><br>

			Love is sadness<br>
			And love is happiness<br><br>
				
			Love hurts<br>
			And love heals<br><br>

			Love drains<br>
			And love sustains<br><br>

			Love makes you do stupid things<br>
			And love makes you do the right things<br><br>

			Don’t get me wrong<br>
			Sex is amazing, but<br>

			When I was 6,<br>
			My dad ran over a kid’s foot<br>
			On my way to school<br>
			And he didn't stop<br>
			And I never understood why.<br><br>

			When I was 8,<br>
			My friends hated me for moving away<br>
			Without well wishes, goodbye gifts,<br>
			They called me unfaithful, disloyal<br>
			And I never understood why. <br><br>

			When I was 10,<br>
			My mom had an affair<br>
			My dad turned to me in his frustration<br>
			Tormenting, cursing, calling my mom names<br>
			Yet he never got a divorce<br>
			And I never understood why.<br><br>
			
			My family never recovered<br>
			My friends never talked to me again<br>
			And I still think of that boy,<br>
			Whose toe my dad crushed<br>
			And I never understood why. <br><br>

			When I was 16,<br>
			I got my first heartbreak<br>
			The pain went on for months,<br>
			And we were never friends again<br>
			And I never understood why.<br><br>

			When I was 18,<br>
			I moved to the U.S.<br>
			My dad wanted to reconnect with me<br>
			Trying to care, showing me love<br>
			But I never responded,<br>
			And I never understood why. <br><br>

			When I was 20,<br>
			I was chosen to lead<br>
			An organization<br>
			Filled with kindness, compassion,<br>
			And a hope for a more empathic world<br>
			And I never understood why. <br><br>

			I never understand why<br>
			I still miss my friends<br>
			The ones who left, and the ones I left behind<br>
			Yet I can’t show my dad forgiveness.<br><br>

			I never understand why<br>
			I try so hard to be kind<br>
			To other people, strangers, people<br>
			I will never see again.<br>
			Yet I can’t be kind to myself.<br><br>

			I never understand why<br>
			There are so many problems in the world<br>
			Why people are so greedy, so discontent,<br>
			So aloof, so indifferent<br>
			And I am the same.<br><br>

			I never understand why<br>
			I run away from my religion<br>
			Yet I still believe God exist<br>
			I guess I just don’t care for their retribution anymore.<br><br>

			I lack kindness, empathy, and understanding<br>
			I lack what makes me human, what makes us humans.<br>
			And I think a lot of us are the same, too. <br><br>

			We shy from conversations that makes us uncomfortable<br>
			We hide away from communication, from confrontation, from conflict<br>
			We only care about ourselves<br>
			We only care if we make enough money<br>
			If we can be the best, if we can live comfortably<br>
			And we don’t care about anything else<br>
			And I never understand why.<br>

			We should care<br>
			We should be kind<br>
			We should give a shit<br>
			About something.<br>
			About anything.<br>
			Pick one. There are a million problems,<br>
			And a million more, and a million more after that.<br>
			Pick one.<br>
			Pick anything.<br>
			Choose kindness, instead of indifference.<br>
			Choose understanding, instead of ignorance.<br>
			Choose empathy, instead of apathy.<br>
			Please.<br>
			Hurry up please,<br>
			It’s time.<br><br>
